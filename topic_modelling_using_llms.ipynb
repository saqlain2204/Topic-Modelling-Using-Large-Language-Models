    "### In conclusion, our work provides an approach to analyzing research literature across critical domains using a combination of advanced techniques. By leveraging LLaMA 2 for generating semantic embeddings, we utilized BERTopic for topic modeling, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and MMR for topic relevance enhancement. These embeddings were clustered with HDBSCAN to uncover meaningful research themes and subtopics within healthcare, economics, climate change, psychology, and artificial intelligence. The integration of graph analytics, including centrality, community detection, k-core analysis, and subgraph analysis, allowed us to uncover hidden patterns, identify influential paper and key research connections.This comprehensive framework offers deep insights into research landscapes.\n"
